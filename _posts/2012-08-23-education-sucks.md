title: Education Sucks

I’m sure most of you, in school, would have said something along the lines of, “I don’t like this subject, and that one… or that one.” But is that the reason why you didn’t like school? I don’t believe so.

The “what the hell am I learning this for?” feeling has hit me numerous times – maybe we should have a little bit more freedom to what we are actually interested in? Of course, it is obvious that the fundamentals need to be there, to give you a general understanding of things, but I believe strongly that school should not what to learn, but how to learn anything and everything we can! There needs to be space for us to develop as much as we want to. Why limit one’s potential to a school year’s curriculum and what’s going to come up on the exams?

> "What the hell am I learning this for?"

Results driven institutions are one of the main factors that lead to this broken system. Somehow we began ranking schools according to the grades their pupils, and inspecting them so that they can be given a label, a rating, much like an exam. Here’s how it works…

For perhaps one week there will be an examiner roaming around to see how the school is performing. But, the school knows when he’s coming, much like a student does know the exam date. The school prepares itself for that week, including preparing the pupils, so that during that period it is better, and different, to how it might otherwise be. The results come back and the school grade is, often, very high, but is it representative? Ask any school child whether the teaching is the same in inspection week and they’ll tell you: no.

Now, I ask you, what does that teach our kids? To get out there, find and learn about what they love, and to find and be themselves, or that an exam grade is more important? This actually scares me; what kind of people are schools are producing? Isn’t it just typical human behaviour, to do things with the short term in mind, with no regard for the long game?

After high school experiences like this, kids are literally herded to university. To many, it’s not just the obvious choice, but the only one presented to them. Go to uni, get the experience, and the debt, and then worry about life. I love university, and I am having a great time by the way, but this system is just broken in many ways, in some ways, even, is restricting our minds. What would you think if you heard, “We don’t need to learn that because it’s not on the exam”, from a teacher?

So, on to the reason I am writing this post.

I have, for a long time, been waiting for a project that I could believe in and be extremely passionate about. I think this problem is one of those things that comes to you once in a lifetime, and if you had the same opportunity at a later point in life it just wouldn’t be the same. Luckily I’ve got a good friend who thinks on the same wavelength as me: Tom Ashworth (@phuu), he has also written something about the same post, check it out. We’ve been talking about doing projects together for a while and it turned out we’d been thinking of creating something that could—read well what I’m going to say now—try to help, and maybe change, the way things are done in some aspects of the education system.

We can’t talk a lot about this just yet because we don’t even know where this project is going to take us! But it’s a project, and it’s taking some sort of shape… ideas are flowing alongside excitement.
