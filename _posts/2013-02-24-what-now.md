### The year of Laravel?

I recently read [this](https://tutsplus.com/tutorial/why-laravel-is-taking-the-php-community-by-storm/) article, and I completely agree. PHP was sucking, laravel however, it's unbelievable.

Over the years PHP had been fading away, considering RoR's predominance on the webapp scenario, the programming language that was the heart of applications for years was simply, almost, put in the corner. Now, I understand why some people hate PHP, it ain't that pretty.

I then found, laravel, by trying to dig and learn more about the MVC design pattern I came across this not so acclaimed framework. It simply blew my mind on how easy it is to use, authentication, routes, eloquent, fluent querying. It is sophisticated, simple & efficient.

Short post, laravel is definitely worth looking at. I'm doing my best to convert my peers back to PHP.

Laters.
